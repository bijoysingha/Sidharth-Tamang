# Sidharth-Tamang
This project provides a lightweight emulator setup using QEMU on Android via Termux, allowing users to boot and run their own operating system ISO files, such as Windows 7, in a virtual environment. It includes only open-source tools and user-friendly scripts to assist with creating virtual hard drives, booting ISO files, and managing virtual machines on mobile devices. This repository does not contain or distribute any proprietary files, such as Windows ISOs or licensed software â€” users must supply these files themselves from legal sources. The purpose of this project is educational and intended for personal experimentation, virtualization learning, and systems research on Android devices. All usage must comply with local laws and software license agreements.
