# QEMU Windows ISO Booter for Android (via Termux)

This project provides scripts and instructions for running ISO-based operating systems, such as Windows or Linux, on Android devices using QEMU within Termux. It is designed to help users emulate virtual machines directly on their phones, allowing them to experiment with different operating systems in a virtual environment without the need for root access. The project is fully open-source and includes no proprietary software — it does not contain or distribute Windows ISO files, product keys, or any licensed binaries. Users are expected to provide their own ISO files legally obtained from official or authorized sources. 

The goal of this project is purely educational. It allows users to learn about virtualization, system architecture, disk management, and QEMU usage in a safe and legal way. This project is intended only for personal use, testing, and academic exploration. Any misuse of this tool — including using pirated ISOs or distributing licensed software — is strictly discouraged and is the responsibility of the user. The author of this repository is not responsible for how others use the scripts or tools provided here.

Please ensure that your usage complies with all applicable software licenses and local laws. By using this project, you agree to use it ethically, legally, and solely for non-commercial and educational purposes. This project is provided "as is" with no warranties or guarantees. Contributions are welcome to help improve the tool while keeping it open and compliant with software and platform policies.
